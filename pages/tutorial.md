# WidgetKit Code Tutorial

## Overview

For this iOS programming tutorial, we will be creating an app to tell us the hours of GVSU's libraries. Using WidgetKit, we will be able to create widgets that show up to date information at a glance. Since we don't have room to show all four libraries, we'll have to allow the user to select an individual library to focus on and must decide what information to show/omit at different sizes.
