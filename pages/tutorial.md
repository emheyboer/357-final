# WidgetKit Code Tutorial

## Overview

For this iOS programming tutorial, we will be creating an app to tell us the hours of GVSU's libraries. Using WidgetKit, we will be able to create widgets that show up to date information at a glance. Since we don't have room to show all four libraries, we'll have to allow the user to select an individual library to focus on and must decide what information to show/omit at different sizes.

## Getting Started

All we need to get started on this app is Xcode. On macos, you can install Xcode through the App Store.

Once it's installed, you will be prompted to install the iOS simulator and other parts of the development toolchain. Once you have those installed, we can move on to starting our app.

## Steps

### Creating Our Project

Once you start Xcode for the first time, you will be prompted to create a new project from a template. Select App from the iOS tab and click "Next".

On the next page, you will be prompted for some more information about this app. The product name and organization identifier are up to you, but make sure to choose Swift for the language and SwiftUI for the interface. Then click "Next"

Finally, you have to choose where this project will go. Once you've chosen the destination, click "Create". Congrats! You now have a working app in Xcode.
