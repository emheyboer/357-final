# Is The Library Open

##  Project Description

The GVSU Library WidgetKit involves being able to select from GVSU's four libraries which includes the Mary Idema Pew Libary, Steelcase Library, Frey Foundation Learning Commons, and Lemmen Library & Archives. There's a menu to select from when you hold down on the widget in which you will be able to select one of the libraries and if you want to change the size of the widget, you can change the size to small, medium, or large based on your preference. We use a API that will pull the hours from the GVSU libraries based on the current day and you will also be able to see images of the libraries for the medium and large widgets.
